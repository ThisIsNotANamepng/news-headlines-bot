Despite the argument "blah blah blah has been in the news recently" or "we never talk about this anymore" being used often (especially in talks about culture) there's no hard data tracking exactly what was said when

There are a number of datasets which have news headlines, some with very many, but none track them as they change over long periords of time (IE https://felixludos.github.io/babel-briefings/ has many but only from 2020-2021 and https://commoncrawl.org/overview has them for decades but only track once per year)

So this project aims to create a dataset of news headlines as they change over a long period of time. IE grabbing what the headlines were on the front page of a bunch of news sites every 10 minutes
